# Processing --> p5.js

Use this repository to publish a processing sketch to the web using p5.js. Follow the instructions below to stay on the path to success. Unlike previous work repositories, this one is _public_ and you have been given administrator access to it. This is so that the repository can be used via GitHub pages as a web host. Normal github accounts cannot use GitHub pages on private repositories, and you need administartor rights in order to enable this feature.

### Step 0: Enable Pages

[Follow these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) to turn on the GitHub pages service. After enabling, it may take a few minutes for the page to be ready.

If you were successful, the page should look just [like this](https://stuycs-gh-classrooms.github.io/nextcs-l06-web/)
